# LiriBot

### A CLI app that searches three different APIs and retrieves specific information to the User.  

## The first command will search the OMDB API. Here is the command the user will have to input:

![movie-this](./images/movie-this.png)

## Using axios, the command will retrieve the information to deliever it to the user: 

![movie-this-result](./images/movie-this-result.png)

## The same will happen with the Bands in Town API using the concert-this command as seen below:

![concert-this](./images/concert-this.png)

![concert-this-result](./images/concert-this-result.png)

## Liri Bot also uses the Spotify API. However, Sportify has it's own retrieval information through node. The "node-spotify-api" npm package was
## used to allow song information retrieval as seen below:
![spotify-this-song](./images/spotify-this-song.png)

![spotify-result](./images/spotify-result.png)

## The fourth command, do-what-it-says, will have node read from a file and executing the search written in it: 

![whatItSays.png](./images/whatItSays.png)

![whatItsays-result.png](./images/whatItsays-result.png)
